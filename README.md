# Nix Home

Nix Home is an ecosystem built to declaratively develop robots and other appliances that integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

This project is currently a long term experiment. While promising, it is far from stabilized and may later be broken up into smaller projects.

## [rhome-cli](packages/rhome-cli/README.md)

A command line interface for building and deploying software to robots and appliances.

## [Home Assistant Bridge](homeassistant/home_assistant_bridge/)

A node for bridging ROS and Home Assistant together. You can call ROS services from Home Assistant and Home Assistant actions from ROS.
